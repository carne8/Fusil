# [Fable](https://fable.io) compatibility
This library is **NOT** compatible with [Fable](https://fable.io).  
However, there is a good JS alternative available: [fzf-for-js](https://fzf.netlify.app/docs/latest).

# Demo
A demo is currently in development.  
This library will also be integrated into one of my upcoming projects: [Starter](https://github.com/carne8/Starter).

# Usage
Examples coming soon...

# Benchmark
Yes, yes, benchmarks are coming. I’m not claiming it’s fast yet.

When a French tries to prononce *"Fuzzy"*, it sounds like *"Fusil"* (which means *"gun"* in French).  
That's why I called it *"Fusil"* (and not *"Fuzzy"*).
